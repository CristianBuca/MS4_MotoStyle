            "description": "The Leatt Moto 7.5 V22 is a premium quality off-road helmet made from injected Polymer Compound and comes with a pair of matching Leatt Velocity 4.5 goggles. Three shell sizes ensure a close and comfortable fit with superior aerodynamics with four densities of impact foam for reducing forces to the head and brain in the event of an impact. It is lightweight, weighs 1.295 +50g, features ECE 22.06 approval, and exceeds new FIM standards. Large ventilation channels to keep your head cool even at lower speeds, and the inner liner is washable, breathable and has moisture-wicking anti-odour fabric to keep you fresh. It is designed to offer excellent neck brace mobility, and the helmet peak has a breakaway function to reduce forces to the head and neck in a crash with emergency release cheek pads. It also comes equipped with a hydration side port (an optional hands-free kit sold separately) and helmet peak extension. The double D closure system is both adjustable and ultra-secure. In addition, Leatt helmets feature category-defining 360° Turbine Technology. The helmet is lined with 360-degree turbines, which are discs constructed from an energy-absorbing material that allows the head to move slightly inside the helmet during a crash, reducing rotational, direct and deflective impact energy. This technology has two key advantages: reducing rotational acceleration to the head and brain and absorbing energy upon impact at the concussion level. The reduced peak reduces brain acceleration by up to 30% at impact speeds associated with concussion and reduces peak brain rotational acceleration by up to 40%. Available in a choice of colours and designs with matching items available - this is the Black colourway.",
